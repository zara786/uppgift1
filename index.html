                  <span>This week we’ll be discussing the concept of <strong>"Youtubability"</strong> -</span>
                  <span>another important game guideline.</span>

                  <h2>Youtubability</h2>
                  <p>A key driver of youtubability is <strong style="color:#6f7175">the clarity of your gameplay</strong> to a potential player.</p>
                  <p>Gameplay clarity will help you achieve the full potential of your game by working on getting <strong style="color:#6f7175">the lowest possible CPIs</strong> for your games.</p>
                  <p>Many elements can be used to make your game clearer :</p>
               </section>
               <div class="para2">
                  <p>For instance, ask yourself if a user’s inte-raction with the game is <strong style="color:#6f7175">evident</strong>, for example, can she tell which character she <strong style="color:#6f7175">controls?</strong> Is the <strong style="color:#6f7175">objective clear?</strong> Does it look <strong style="color:#6f7175">fun to play?</strong> Has she understood the game after 1 second (great!) or after 10 seconds (too long!).</p>
                  <p>Make sure to <strong style="color:#6f7175">use colours</strong> to help indicate the gameplay rules. For instance, in Helix Jump, obstacles are <strong style="color:#6f7175">clearly contrasted</strong> (in orange here) and instantly recognized as a threat.</p>

                  <p>If you want to run user tests with friends and family or even random people in the street, it is interesting to show them the 30 second video before making them try to prototype in order to <strong style="color:#6f7175">understand their</strong> expectations f rom the video vs. the actual game they try.</p>
                  <br/>
                  <p><strong style="color:#6f7175">Make it obvious</strong> with visual elements that help <strong style="color:#6f7175">understand the objective and controls</strong> of the game, like with the target used in Viatcheslav Tarasov’s Purple Diver or Fabrika Games’ Draw Car with the space dedicated to drawing.</p>

               <div class="text-3">
                  <p>People will be watching the gameplay videos of your games <strong style="color:#6f7175">on their phone’s Facebook feed</strong>, everything will seem smaller than when displayed in Unity or as a video on your computer screen. <strong style="color:#6f7175">You should also consider whether your gameplay video is understandable if someone watches it on a small screen.</strong> With an average watch time of 3 to 5 seconds, this is an <strong style="color:#6f7175">accelerated elevator pitch!</strong></p>
                  <br/>
                  <p>Think of the moment when you decide to click on a random video on YouTube just because it has an attractive thumbnail - it’s the same idea for your game videos.</p>
